      <description>For this 53rd Tuesday in 2019, #TidyTuesday is a byod (bring-your-own-data) special. For this week, I’ll take a look at one of the weeks I missed from earlier in 2019. I’m only a few years removed from my grad school days, so government spending on R&amp;amp;D is an interest of mine. Week 7 it is: Federal R&amp;amp;D Spending. This is a very short post, but I have family in town, so I don’t wan tot go too far down a rabbit hole.</description>
